## Blackjack Game ðŸ‚¡ðŸ‘‘
Blackjack is a card game that pits the player against the dealer. This Python project replicates and implements the rules of the game.

# Instructions

The objective is to deal both user and computer a starting hand of 2 random card values. The game will only show the 2 cards on hand of the user, and will only show 1 card from the computer's hand. 
Then, the game will detect if the computer or user has a blackjack on the first 2 cards provided (ACE + FACE CARDS). 
If no blackjack on first cards, the computer will ask the user if they want to get another card or to pass.

If the user decided to pass, the dealer will draw a card if their cards are below 17 or will just show the cards if it is greater than 17.

Your final hand: [3, 8], final score: 11
Dealer's final hand: [3, 8, 4, 4], final score: 19

Dealer wins!

Your final hand: [10, 9], final score: 19

```

If the user decided to get another card, the new card will then be added to the 2 cards the user already have. This can be done multiple times until the user is satisfied with the total number they have. 
However, keep in mind that if the user's total number exceeds 21, they will automatically lose the round.
